# American_Sign_Letters_Detection

This project focuses on hand detection of American sign letters using Python, Numpy, cvzone, the cv2 library (OpenCV), and the math library.
In this project, I have created two Python files: "data.py" and "main.py".

The "data.py" file serves the purpose of collecting the images of sign letters from the user.
This step is essential for creating a dataset that will be used later for training and testing the hand detection algorithm. 
It is likely that the "data.py" file prompts the user to perform different American sign letters gestures while capturing 
the corresponding images using the webcam or a similar device.

The "main.py" file is responsible for the implementation of the project. It uses the collected dataset of sign letters images to train a hand detection model. 
The cv2 library (OpenCV) provides useful functionalities and algorithms for computer vision tasks, such as hand detection. 
By utilizing appropriate techniques from the cv2 library, the "main.py" file processes the images, detects and extracts the hands from the sign letter gestures.

The math library, on the other hand, is likely used for mathematical computations and calculations that might be required during the hand detection process. 
It may involve tasks such as normalization, feature extraction, or manipulating the hand region to improve accuracy and robustness.

Overall, in this project, the combination of Python, the cv2 library, and the math library allows for the development of a hand detection system 
specifically tailored for American sign letters. The "data.py" file enables the collection of a diverse dataset of sign letter images, and 
the "main.py" file implements the hand detection algorithm using the collected data.
